"""
The BayesNet module contains an implementation of IRT and related models as a Probabilistic
Graphical Model. Observed and latent variables are represented by nodes in the graph.  Each node
contains the data (state of the variable), the conditional probability distribution of the data
given the parameters, links to nodes holding latent variables, and auxiliary parameters related to
the optimization of its variables.  A learner object provides a thin wrapper for the probabilistic
graph and learning is performed by coordinate ascent on each node's probability function.
